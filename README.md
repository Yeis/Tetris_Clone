# Tetris_Clone
Clone of Tetris game using SDL and C++  
 Implementation based on the tutorials of 
 Aaron's Tutorialsw  http://www.aaroncox.net/tutorials/miscellaneous/STL.html\
 LazzyFoo Productions http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php
 
 What I actually did was take all the assets from the tetris tutorial and some of the logic, and migrate the solution from 
 SDL 1.4.3 to a working version on SDL 2.X
